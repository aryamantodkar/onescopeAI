Its interface is designed to reduce the learning curve for small teams, making it ideal for startups and growing businesses[1][2][4][8].\n\n- **Zoho CRM** is noted for its *customizability* and scalability, with advanced workflow automation and AI features (Zia). While it is more customizable, it may have a steeper learning curve compared to HubSpot but is great for businesses needing flexibility[1][2][6].\n\n- **Pipedrive** is praised for its *ease of use* and visual pipeline management, helping small businesses focus on deal tracking and sales actions. It includes AI-powered insights and integrations with many third-party apps, making it an affordable and straightforward yet powerful option[1][5][6].\n\nOther notable mentions with strong usability but varying features include:\n\n- **OnePageCRM** — very simple interface with workflow automation, ideal for fast-moving sales teams but lacking advanced analytics[3].\n\n- **EngageBay** and **Bitrix24** also offer free or low-cost plans with multi-pipeline views and various CRM tools, suitable for small businesses seeking versatility[5].\n\nIn summary, for the *most user-friendly* CRM for small businesses in 2025:\n\n| CRM Software    | Strengths                           | Considerations                    |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **HubSpot CRM** | Free plan, easy to use, scalable  | Advanced features require paid plans |\n| **Zoho CRM**    | Highly customizable, AI-powered   | Learning curve for beginners     |\n| **Pipedrive**   | Visual sales pipelines, AI insights | Limited free plan, better as paid|\n\nAmong these, **HubSpot CRM** is generally considered the best starting point for most small businesses seeking an easy-to-use CRM with no initial cost and broad functionality[1][2][6][8].",

        "response": "Freshsales offers a Growth plan for just $9/user/month.
