        "response": "**HubSpot CRM** stands out as the best all-in-one CRM for a small marketing agency due to its free core platform combining sales pipelines, email marketing, forms, landing pages, live chat, and marketing-sales alignment tools, making it highly suitable for budget-conscious agencies handling leads and campaigns.[3][6][9]\n\n### Why HubSpot Fits Small Marketing Agencies\n- **All-in-One Capabilities**: Offers marketing automation, sales tracking, contact management, and deal pipelines without extra costs on the free plan, ideal for agencies needing integrated tools for client campaigns and lead nurturing.[3][6]\n- **User-Friendly for Small Teams**: Praised for ease of use, free entry-level access, and scalability to paid plans (Growth at $29/month, Pro at $69/month), supporting growth without high upfront investment.[3][5][9]\n- **Marketing-Specific Strengths**: Includes email tracking, forms, and website activity insights, directly addressing agency needs like campaign management and client engagement.[6][9]\n\n### Top Alternatives Comparison\nOther strong options vary by focus like affordability or customization. Here's a comparison of highly rated all-in-one CRMs for small agencies:\n\n| CRM | Key Strengths for Agencies | Pricing Starting Point | Ratings/Notes [Sources] |\n|----|----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| **EngageBay** | Comprehensive marketing, sales, support in one budget-friendly platform; great for streamlining client management. | Free tier available | 4.6/5 [2][6] |\n| **Zoho CRM** | Affordable multichannel engagement, AI analytics, extensive integrations; flexible for customization. | Free for basics; $14/user/month paid | 4.5/5; 6.7/10 [2][5][6] |\n| **BIGContacts** | Contact management, email marketing automation, sales pipelines; user-friendly for SMB agencies. | Free trial; paid from ~$5/user/month (implied) | Top pick for agencies [4] |\n| **Salesflare** | High-rated (9.7/10) for automation and unified client/projects; strong for marketing workflows. | Paid plans from ~$29/user/month | Agency-focused [5][7] |\n| **Freshsales (Freshworks)** | AI insights, email tracking, automation for SMBs; good for sales-marketing blend. | Free tier; paid from $9/user/month | 6.9/10 [1][5][6] |\n\n### Selection Considerations\n- **Budget and Scale**: HubSpot or EngageBay for free starts; Zoho for low-cost growth.[2][3][6]\n- **Agency Needs**: Prioritize marketing automation (HubSpot, BIGContacts) over enterprise scale (Salesforce, less ideal for small teams).[4][5][9]\n- **Limitations**: Free plans like HubSpot limit advanced reporting; test via trials as needs vary by agency size and workflows.[3][6]\nSources highlight no single \"best\" universally, but HubSpot's free all-in-one marketing features align most closely with small agency requirements across reviews.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]",
